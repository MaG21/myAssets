! Title: Disqus click-to-load
! Author: Gorhill
! From https://gist.github.com/gorhill/ef1b62d606473c68d524
! Check above link for update and samples as well.
! [[ Purpose is to load Disqus comments on demand only, so that no connection
! to `disqus.com` occurs by default when you land on a site which uses
! Disqus comments widget.
! Not connecting to Disqus by default is a good thing for such a
! ubiquitous server as `disqus.com`, which can be used to build a
! profile of your browsing habits, even if you have no account with
! Disqus. This also helps web pages containing the Disqus widget to
! load faster.
! These filters will cause a button labeled:
! "Disqus blocked by uBlock Origin: click to unblock" to be embedded
! where Disqus comments would normally be loaded. Click the button
! to force the comments to be loaded.
! Be sure your filter lists are up to date, new resources have been
! added today [Mar 9, 2016] to make these filters work.]]
