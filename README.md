## Very experimental custom filters
I made these for my personal use. I'm sure a lot of the filters here will actually break some useful sites. Please be cautious and check ublock's logger to see what is getting filtered out, and comment out any problamatic filter.
Use only the filters you're interested in. You might find some useful stuff like the cosmetic filters for MAL. 

I'm relatively new to making filters, so please let me know if I messed up the syntax somewhere or if there are better ways to write them.

### How to use:
Get **uBlock Origin** from **[gorhill's github repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/)**. You will find a detailed guide to installation in the [README.md](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/README.md) file. Everything about uBlock Origin is explained in great detail in there.

Recommended browser: **Mozilla Firefox**

It is highly recommended that you start to use [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix), another extension by the same develeoper, after you get the hang of using uBlock Origin. It gives you more control over your use of the internet.

#### Note: *uBlock Origin* is NOT the same as *uBlock*.
