# Very very experimental custom filters
I'm relatively new to making filters, so please let me know if I messed up the syntax somewhere or if there are better ways to write the filters.
I made these for my personal use. I'm sure a lot of the filters here will actually break some useful sites. Please be cautious and check ublock's logger to see what is getting filtered out, and comment out any problamatic filter.
Really, don't use this list as-is. Please. Use only the filters you're interested in.
You might find some useful stuff like the cosmetic filters for MAL.
