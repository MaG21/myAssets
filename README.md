## Very experimental custom filters
I made these for my personal use. I'm sure a lot of the filters here will actually break some useful sites. Please be cautious and check ublock's logger to see what is getting filtered out, and comment out any problamatic filter.
Use only the filters you're interested in. You might find some useful stuff like the cosmetic filters for MAL. 

I'm relatively new to making filters, so please let me know if I messed up the syntax somewhere or if there are better ways to write them.

### How to use:
Get **uBlock Origin** from **[gorhill's github repository](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/)**. You will find a detailed guide to installation in the [README.md](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/README.md) file. Everything about uBlock Origin is explained in great detail in there.

### Disqus placeholder
Disqus is a popular blog comment hosting service. The purpose of the Disqus placeholder filter is to prevent Disqus from loading on it's own. Doing so will load pages faster and serve to increase your privacy as well. gorhill made it some time ago, I hope it gets integrated into uBlock...

To use it, you can simply copy paste the contents into your "My Filters" tab or add the list just like you add custom filters via URL. You can find more information in **[gorhill's gists](https://gist.github.com/gorhill)**.



Recommended browser: **Firefox** (Dev-edition, Palemoon, Nightly: Any opensource maintained fork will do)

Recommended add-ons: uBlock Origin, uMatrix, Greasemonkey, NoScript.



It is highly recommended that you start to use [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix), another extension by the same develeoper, after you get the hang of using uBlock Origin. It gives you more control over your use of the internet.

#### Note: *uBlock Origin* is NOT the same as *uBlock*.
